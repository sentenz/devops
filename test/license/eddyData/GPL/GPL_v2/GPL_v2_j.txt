 * Remote BIOS Update (rbu) driver is used for updating DELL BIOS by
 * creating entries in the /sys file systems on Linux 2.6 and higher
 * kernels. The driver supports two mechanism to update the BIOS namely
 * contiguous and packetized. Both these methods still require having some
 * application to set the CMOS bit indicating the BIOS to update itself
 * after a reboot.
 *
 * Contiguous method:
 * This driver writes the incoming data in a monolithic image by allocating
 * contiguous physical pages large enough to accommodate the incoming BIOS
 * image size.
 *
 * Packetized method:
 * The driver writes the incoming packet image by allocating a new packet
 * on every time the packet data is written. This driver requires an
 * application to break the BIOS image in to fixed sized packet chunks.
