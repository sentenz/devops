arclog change log

2007-11-28	version 3.00
	 1. t/01-exhaust.t: Fixed so that a zero-sized result file
	    is valid as application/x-bzip2.  This is to fix the
	    issue that Compress::Bzip2 does not write anything if
	    no data is sent to the compression handler.

2007-11-27
	 1. Makefile.PL, Build.PL: Clean-up old file found message.
	 2. Makefile.PL: Added message for optional prerequisites.
	 3. reslog.zh-tw.html, reslog.zh-cn.html: Tag the languages.
	 4. t/02-several.t: Added the missing "several source files
	    all listed as arguments" tests.
	 5. t/01-exhaust.t: Moved @OVERTYPES to t/_helper.t.
	 6. t/02-several.t: Use random log format instead of Apache
	    access log.
	 7. t/03-fallback.t: Added, to test the fall back behavior.

2007-11-26
	 1. t/03-errors.t: Renamed to t/04-errors.t.
	 2. t/01-exhaust.t: Moved @KEEPTYPES to t/_helper.t.
	 3. t/04-errors.t: Fixed to set $num with rand().
	 4. t/_helper.pm, t/*.t: Updated the license to GPLv3.
	 5. arclog.*.html: Added stylesheets and access guide.
	 6. README, README.zh-tw, README.zh-cn: Updated.
	 7. fdl.txt: Added.
	 8. MSWin32 and MS-Win32 is now written as MS-Windows in the
	    documentation.
	 9. arclog: Re-order the debug message in the check_gzip() and
	    check_bzip2() methods of the _private::IO class.
	10. Makefile.PL, Build.PL: Fixed comment typo. ("any old files")
	11. Build.PL: Added "recommends" and "build_requires".

2007-11-25
	 1. t/03-errors.t: Fixed while loop to do...while loop when
	    obtaining output prefix, so that we obtain a random word first.
	 2. t/03-errors.t: Renamed $output to $opref.  Added $oprefb as
	    the base name of the output prefix.
	 3. t/_helper.t: Fixed the errors in the mkrndlog_apache() and
	    mkrndlog_modfiso() subroutines that dump $tzoff as $zoff.
	 4. t/_helper.t: Fixed the timezone representation that mistakenly
	    output -0030 as +0030 in the mkrndlog_apache() and
	    mkrndlog_modfiso() subroutines.  This test suite bug is hard to
	    track, since it only appears with log formats with time zones,
	    in the time zone -0300 and log records in that one-hour
	    boundary.  This chance is too small.  I saw one or two every
	    now and then, and am pretty sure there is a bug, but spent
	    numerous time testing in vain.  I finally got this bug.  Yes!
	 5. t/_helper.t: Fixed the $tzoff calculation from
	    timegm(@_[0...5]) - timelocal(@_[0...5]) to
	    timelocal(localtime) - timelocal(gmtime) in the
	    mkrndlog_apache() and mkrndlog_modfiso() subroutines.
	 6. t/_helper.t: Set time to 00:00:00 in the monrng_rand()
	    subroutine.
	 7. t/02-several.t: Added, to test archiving several log files
	    at once.
	 8. arclog, arclog.en.html, INSTALL: Fixed the typo "archieve"
	    as "archive".
	 9. t/01-exhaust.t: Moved @SRCTYPES to t/_helper.pm so that it can
	    be shared among tests.
	10. reslog: Fixed to return ref($GZIP_IO)->new instead of $GZIP_IO
	    in the check_gzip() method, ref($BZIP2_IO)->new instead of
	    $BZIP2_IO in the check_bzip2() method of the _private::IO class,
	    so that a same I/O handler will not be returned to different log
	    files.

2007-11-24
	 1. arclog: Moved output prefix "-" check to the front in
	    the parse_args() subroutine.
	 2. arclog: Fixed the new() method of the _private::LogFile::STDIN
	    class to unlink0() after checking the file type with the file
	    executable.
	 3. t/_helper.pm: Fixed the mkrndlog_existing() subroutine to
	    obtain the content with anonymous array index but not @_.
	 4. t/_helper.pm: Fixed the mkrndlog_*() subroutines to
	    return @logs and time zone variable dumps for easier debugging.
	 5. t/*.t: Added a debug file to save dumped variables for easier
	    debugging.
	 6. t/02-errors.t: Renamed to t/03-errors.t.
	 7. t/*.t: Renamed the debug file "debug" to "$logfile.debug", so
	    that each log file can have its own variable dump.
	 8. t/03-errors.t: Added "$logfile.debug" to mixing formats tests.
	 9. t/_helper.pm, t/*.t: Renaming $debug to $vardump, and
	    "$logfile.debug" to "$logfile.vardump".

2007-11-23
	 1. t/02-errors.t: Added tests on mixing log formats and STDOUT
	    output prefix.
	 2. t/01-exhaust.t: Moved @LOGFMTS to t/_helper.pm so that it
	    can be shared among tests.

2007-11-22
	 1. arclog: Fixed $SIG{__WARN__} to $SIG{"__WARN__"} in the
	    parse_args() subroutine.
	 2. t/01-exhaust.t: Fixed to loop the override mode in the keep
	    mode.
	 2. t/01-exhaust.t: Removed unused $ce and %fm.
	 3. t/01-exhaust.t: Added the override mode "default".
	 4. t/02-errors.t: Added.

2007-11-20
	 1. t/01-format.t: Removed.  t/03-exhaust.t should do the work.
	 2. t/03-exhaust.t: Renamed to t/01-exhaust.t.
	 3. t/_helper.pm: Removed the logfmts(), srctypes(), restypes(),
	    overtypes() subroutines, and replaced with the @LOGFMTS,
	    @SRCTYPES, @RESTYPES, @OVERTYPES arrays.  These information are
	    only used once in one test.  This makes it simpler.
	 4. t/01-exhaust.t: Finished.  Using loop to test 1800 combinations
	    of options, arguments, file types and file formats.
	 5. t/02-apache.t: Removed.  t/01-exhaust.t has replaced it.
	 6. arclog: Rewrote the new() method of the _private::Format package
	    so that it simply returns the blessed object.  Test the match
	    at in the check_format() method, so that it reports matching tests
	    at $VERBOSE > 2.
	 7. t/01-exhaust.t: Removed the $nofile, $nogzip and $nobzip2
	    variables.  The nofile(), nogzip() and nobzip2() subroutines have
	    replaced them.

2007-11-19
	 1. t/_helper.pm: Removed the mkrndlog_random() subroutine.  It does
	    not look like I'll be using it.
	 2. t/_helper.pm: Fixed the flist() subroutine to exclude non-files.
	 3. t/_helper.pm: Renamed the preserve_source() subroutine to
	    prsrvsrc().
	 4. t/*.t: Removed the strange escaping of double-quotation character
	    of arclog path.
	 5. t/_helper.pm: Fixed the cleanup() subroutine to skip clean-up
	    if the log directory does not exist.
	 6. t/03-exhaust.t: Added to test all the option/argument
	    combinations.

2007-11-18
	 1. arclog: Move the TYPE_PLAIN, TYPE_GZIP and TYPE_BZIP2 constants
	    from the _private::LogFile package to the main package, so that
	    other packages can use it, too.
	 2. arclog: Added $one_arg in the parse_arg() subroutine to deal with
	    only one argument, and check if the only one argument is STDIN in
	    advance.  If a compressd source log file is the only one argument,
	    remove the compresssion suffix (.gz or .bz2) from the output
	    prefix.
	 3. _helper.pm: Added the cleanup() subroutine to clean up after
	    a test.
	 4. _helper.pm: Added the TYPE_PLAIN, TYPE_GZIP and TYPE_BZIP2
	    constants for easier use.
	 5. arclog: Clean up File::Spec::Functions references.
	 6. Makefile.PL and Build.PL: Changed the clean-up list from "t/log/*"
	    to "t/log*".
	 7. t/_helper.pm: Added the preserve_source() subroutine to preserve
	    the source log file for reference.

2007-11-17
	 1. arclog: Fixed the remove_temp() method of the _private::LogFile
	    package, so that it does not try to delete an anonymous
	    temporarily working file.
	 2. t/01-format.t: Fixed the test so that it only remove the working
	    directory on success, and leave the directory on fail.

2007-11-16
	 1. t/_helper, t/01-format.t: Added.  This is the first real test
	    suite that test the functionality of arclog, though it does
	    not cover many of the arclog functionality yet.

2007-11-15
	 1. UPGRADE, UPGRADE.zh-tw, UPGRADE.zh-cn: Added.
	 2. arclog: Rename the add_record() method to add() in the
	    _private::Archive package.
	 3. arclog: Reformatted the POD document.
	 4. arclog: Added the sort() method to the _private::Archive package,
	    and implement the sorting ability.  The new way (sort the
	    record index but not record themseves) seems to have lesser
	    memory impact than the original implementation.
	 5. arclog: Added time zone to the bracked ISO 8601 format.
	 6. Upgrade notes changed from 2.1.1dev3 to 2.1.1dev4.
	 6. arclog: Rename the _private::Format::BracketISO package to
	    _private::Format::ModfISO.  It is not really ISO 8601.

2007-11-14
	 1. Changes.zh-tw, Changes.zh-cn: Removed.  It is too troblesome to
	    maintain 3 copies of the change log.
	 2. arclog: Fixed the rel2abs() subroutine and method so that it use
	    getpwuid() instead of getlogin(), and respect the HOME environment
	    variable for the current user.
	 3. arclog: Renamed the new_read() method as open_read(), the
	    new_write() method as open_write(), the new_append() method
	    as open_append().  Replaced the strange architech that start
	    a new instance with $ioclass, with reusing the same $io object.
	 4. arclog: Removed the Chinese GPL copyright message.  There should
	    only be one version of the copyright message, and should not be
	    any Chinese comment.
	 5. Moved from GPLv2 to GPLv3.
	 6. COPYING.zh-tw, COPYING.zh-cn: Removed.  The Chinese translation
	    of GPLv3 is not available yet.
	 7. arclog: Removed subroutines arc_log(), open_src(), sort_arcs(),
	    save_arcs(), check_file_type(), check_gzip(), check_bzip2(),
	    format_number().  They are not used anymore.
	 8. arclog: Fixed the read_source() method to save the record count
	    for later use (like progress bar).
	 9. arclog: Added show_progress() to show the progress bar.
	10. Makefile.PL: Fixed to follow the Perl installation location,
	    but not making our own.
	11. Build.PL: Added.
	12. NEW, NEWS.zh-tw, NEWS.zh-cn: Removed, to follow the CPAN release
	    style.
	13. arclog: Disallow archiving a same log file more than once.
	14. arclog: Fixed parse_args() and removed the duplicated short help
	    on Getopt::Long::GetOptions errors.
	15. arclog: Remove the _private::Format->to_yyyymm() method.  The
	    main utility to_yyyymm() subroutine can be used.  There shouldn't
	    be 2 to_yyyymm() that do the same thing.
	16. arclog: Adding statistics report to the
	    _private::LogFile->restore_this_month() method and the
	    _private::Archive->store_archive() method.
	17. arclog: Removed the _private::LogFile->rel2abs() method.  The
	    main utility rel2abs() subroutine can be used.  There shouldn't
	    be 2 rel2abs() that do the same thing.
	18. arclog: Fixed show_progress() to reset the clean-up the start
	    time when progress is finished.
	19. arclog: Fixed the close() method of the _private::IO::* packages
	    so that KEEP_THISMONTH restart the log file, too.
	19. arclog: Added the prepend_records() method to the _private::IO::*
	    packages, and use prepend_records() to return the records of
	    this month, so that we can take the advantage of open() only once
	    on plain text I/O.

2007-11-13
	 1. arclog, arclog.en.html: Changed "don't" to "do not", "can't" to
	    "cannot", "there's" to "there is", "it's" to "it is", "we'll" to
	    "we will", "I'd" to "I had", "that's" to "that is", "this month's
	    temporary file" to "the temporary file of this month", to help
	    editor syntax highlighting.
	 2. arclog: Add commented single quotation mark to the end of
	    regular expressions that has a single quotation mark, to help
	    editor syntax highlighting.
	 3. arclog: Changed "Deal the ~ home directories under UNIX" to
	    "Deal with the ~ user home directories under UNIX",
	    "If start from user's home directory" to
	    "If it starts from the user home directory".
	 4. arclog: Changed "$VERBOSE >= 2" to "$VERBOSE > 1", $VERBOSE >= 1"
	    to "$VERBOSE > 0".
	 5. arclog: Finished the _private::LogFile->check_format() method.
	    Fixed the parse_args() subroutine to skip empty files, and exit
	    if no non-empty files left.
	 6. arclog: Fixed parse_args() to treat "/dev/stdin" as STDIN on
	    UNIX-like systems.
	 7. arclog: Changed " -- " to " - " in comment.
	 8. arclog: Add the new() methods of the _private::Format::* packages
	    so that it judges if the log record belong to its format and
	    return accordingly, in order to judge and initialize at a time,
	    to simplify the code.
	 9. arclog: Add the name() methods to the _private::Format::* packages
	    to return the format name.
	10. arclog: Moved the check_gzip() method and the check_bzip2() method
	    from the _private::LogFile package to the _private::IO package, so
	    that other packages can access them too.  Remove the $self in
	    the check_gzip() method and the check_bzip2() method.  They are not
	    used at all, and these 2 methods are run as static method now.
	11. arclog: Changed $OUTPUT to $CONF{"OUTPUT"}.
	12. arclog: Added the suffix() method to the _private::IO::* packages.
	13. arclog: Added the _private::Archive package.

2002-09-18	version 2.1.0dev2
	SourceForge Memorial Release.  It's my first time
	to apply a project from SourceForge.  Mostly are
	corrections to the documentation.  SourceForge's
	project page is added to the available download
	source here.
	 1. arclog.pl's official home page at Tavern
	    IMACAT's was restored.
	 2. The previous version was renamed from
	    2.1.0-dev1 to 2.1.0dev1, in order to unify
	    the version number theme.
	 3. The project space at SourceForge was applied.
	    Package files are uploaded to SourceForge now.
	 4. Project virtual host at SourceForge was set up.
	 5. SourceForge was added into the documentation
	    as an official website and download source.
	 6. Documentation were corrected.  Too many places
	    were corrected.  Ignored.
	 7. HTML document was rewritten to accommodate
	    XHTML 1.1 recommendation.

2002-08-31	version 2.1.0dev1
	Rewrite after almost 1 year, to be run on the
	newly-released perl 5.8.0.
	 1. Filehandles are now saved and passed in global
	    named variables.  This is the way it should be.
	    The old way (initialize the file handles by
	    duplicate the STDIN and assign them) was just
	    not natural.  It works in perl 5.6.1, but not in
	    perl 5.8.0.  The duplicated filehandles are
	    constants, which cannot be assigned new values.
	 2. Indents are changed from 1 tab to 4 columns, to
	    accommodate the perl style guide documented in
	    perlstyle(1).  This increases the code
	    readability.
	 3. File operation error handlers are now using the
	    low-precedence logical "or", instead of "||",
	    which is recommended in perlop(1).  Excessive
	    parentheses in file operation functions are
	    removed for this.
	 4. Traditional Chinese files are now named with
	    suffix ".zh-tw" instead of ".b5".  Simplified
	    Chinese files are now named with suffix ".zh-cn"
	    instead of ".gb".  This is to accommodate
	    RFC-3066, ISO 639:1988, ISO 3166-1 for language
	    names.
	 5. PGP signatures of distribution files are added.
	 6. bzip2 distribution files are added.

2001-07-18	version 2.0.6
	 1. A bug that regular expression cannot recognize
	    apache log format when a user logged in with
	    a username containing spaces, was solved.
	 2. A bug that a hyper reference in the English
	    document was not specified as an absolute URL,
	    was fixed.

2001-07-18	version 2.0.5
	 1. A bug that record counter $total was not
	    initialized at all, was fixed.

2001-07-16	version 2.0.4
	 1. open_src() was added, as reslog.pl, to read the
	    source log file by complex rules.
	 2. Support to reading the gzipped log file was
	    added.
	 3. Program execution message was turned from STDOUT
	    to STDERR.
	 4. Processing with Compress::Zlib was modified.
	    gzopen() was modified to open file handles if
	    possible. Return values was checked more
	    strictly. Source of error messages was
	    corrected.

2001-06-29	version 2.0.3
	 1. The default keep mode was changed to
	    "this-month".
	 2. The default keep mode "all" when "--keep" is
	    specified without mode, was added.
	 3. The single-letter abbreviations of the override
	    and keep modes were added

2001-06-29	version 2.0.2
	 1. A bug that won't delete the source empty file
	    under keep-delete mode, was fixed

2001-06-28	version 2.0.1
	 1. A bug that will stop executing when an empty
	    file is met, was fixed.
	 2. "none" keep mode was removed. "restart" and
	    "delete" keep modes were added.
	 3. Precheck on empty files was added. It bounces
	    directly when an empty file is found in the
	    first sight.
	 4. A bug that there's no documentation on --keep
	    option in the HTML documents, was fixed. :p
	 5. The suffix of the temporary working file was
	    changed to ".tmp-arclog".
	 6. A typo of "-dhqv" instead of "options" in the
	    help message was fixed

2001-06-28	version 2.0.0
	Temporary working file was introduced to reduce the
	time working on the source log file.
	 1. Temporary working file was introduced. The
	    source log file was copied to the temporary
	    working file and restart first, to maximum
	    reduce the time occupying it, avoiding usage
	    of other scripts to restart the log file first.
	 2. A bug that, when keep status falls back to all,
	    wrong variable was modified, was fixed. :p

2001-06-28	version 1.6.1
	 1. Reuse of monthly temporary working file to
	    reduce the read time for multiple files.

2001-06-27	version 1.6.0
	Multiple log files was added.
	 1. Main program codes were moved to arc_log(), to
	    loop multiple log files.

2001-06-11	version 1.5.1
	1. A serious bug was fixed. :p I was planning to set
	   the memory limit dymatically but failed. And I
	   forgot to return the original codes, which
	   prevents the program from running.
	2. The argument checking was modified to report
	   error if more than necessary arguments are
	   supplied.

2001-06-10	version 1.5.0
	Read from STDIN was supported.
	 1. Read the log file from STDIN as "-" was added.
	 2. "--prefix" option was removed. The output prefix
