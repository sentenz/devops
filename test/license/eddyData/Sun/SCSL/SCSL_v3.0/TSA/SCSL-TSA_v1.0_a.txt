TECHNOLOGY SPECIFIC ATTACHMENT TO THE SUN COMMUNITY SOURCE LICENSE JINI TECHNOLOGY CORE PLATFORM Version: 3.0/Jini TSA 1.0


1. Effect. This Technology Specific Attachment to the Commercial Use Supplement applies to the Jini Technology Core Platform as described on the Technology Site. The rights and responsibilities set forth in this Technology Specific Attachment are additional to those in Your License and the CUSupp. The term "License" hereinafter refers to the License, the CUSupp, and this Technology Specific Attachment.


2. Additional Requirements and Responsibilities. In addition to the requirements and responsibilities specified in the License, and as a condition to exercising the rights granted therein, You agree to the following additional requirements and responsibilities:


a) Distribution of Source Code. Source Code of a Compliant Implementation authorized for distribution for Commercial Use may be distributed only to another Commercial Use Licensee of the same Technology. You must include a prominent notice with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code that You distribute indicating that use is limited to Licensees in good standing and is subject to the terms and conditions of this License. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code of Covered Code that alters the recipient's rights, requirements, and responsibilities under the recipient's License.


b) Upgraded Code. From time to time, Original Contributor may post Upgraded Code to the community web-server described at the Technology Site. Upgraded Code as used in this Section 2 means new versions of the Technology designated by Original Contributor as an upgrade to the Technology at the Technology Site. Wherever commercially and technically reasonable, You agree that each release by You of a product comprising or incorporating a Compliant Implementation will implement the most current Upgraded Code available no less than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to Your Commercial Use of such Compliant Implementation. If you determine that it is not commercially or technically reasonable to incorporate Upgraded Code as contemplated, You are then not required to incorporate such Upgraded Code provided that, from the date one hundred twenty (120) days after such Upgraded Code is first made commercially available, You may not thereafter, for Commercial Use, distribute any new Modifications or Interfaces, alone or integrated with Covered Code or other code, unless and until such time as You incorporate the then-current Upgraded Code and pass the associated TCK. You may, however make Error Corrections and You may correct the adverse effect of a failure of Your Modifications and Interfaces to perform their functions. It is Original Contributor's intent to maintain compatibility between Covered Code and Upgraded Code.


c) Additional Services. If you provide any services, in the form of interfaces or otherwise, whose functions are substantially similar to those core services whose Interfaces are provided under this License (the "Standard Service Interfaces"), then You must also support the Standard Service Interfaces in Your product or technology. In addition, You must support Standard Service Interfaces associated with Upgraded Code in connection with Your Commercial Use of Compliant Implementations in the same manner as required for Upgraded Code under Section 2.b.


d) Branding. Compliant Implementations used for Commercial Use may, at Your option, be branded with the Technology compliance logo under a separate trademark license to be executed by You and Original Contributor concurrent with execution of this Technology Specific Attachment.


3. Support Programs.


a) Support to You. Technical support is not provided to You by Original Contributor under this License. You may obtain one or more support programs, if available, from Original Contributor relating to the Technology which are described on the Technology Site.


b) Customer Support. You are responsible for providing technical and maintenance support services to Your customers for Your products and services incorporating the Compliant Implementation.


4. Royalties and Payments.


Royalty per Unit $: None.


5. Compliance Materials; Use Restrictions.


Compliance Materials: Jini Technology Core Platform Compatibility Kit


a) The Compliance Materials for the Technology may be accessed at the Technology Site.


b) You are not authorized to create derivative works of the Compliance Materials or use the Compliance Materials to test any implementation of the Technology Specifications that are not Covered Code. You shall only use the Compliance Materials for purposes of verifying compatibility with the Technology Specifications. You must not publish your test results or make claims of comparative compatibility with respect to other implementations of the Technology Specifications. In consideration for the license grant in Section III.A of the CUSupp, You agree not to develop Your own tests which

are intended to validate conformance with the Technology Specifications.


c) Notwithstanding subsection 6.b above, You may use and modify the Source Code of programming code contained in the Compliance Materials for the sole purpose of creating error corrections or modifications to the Compliance Materials to propose to Original Contributor for inclusion in the Compliance Materials. You may not use such modified code for any other purpose including, without limitation, in testing Covered Code pursuant to Section III.A. Any changes to the Compliance Materials which you propose to Original Contributor shall be subject to the license grant set forth in Section III.B.


6. Requirements for Determining Compliance.


a) Development Restrictions. A Compliant Implementation:


i. must fully comply with the Technology Specifications for the Technology to which this Technology Specific Attachment applies; and


ii. must not modify or extend the required public class or public interface declarations whose names begin with "java", "javax", "jini", "net.jini", "sun.hotjava", "COM.sun" or their equivalents in any subsequent class, interface and/or package naming convention adopted by Original Contributor. It is specifically suggested that You name any new Java packages using the "Unique Package Naming Convention" as described in "The Java Language Specification" by James Gosling, Bill Joy, and Guy Steele, ISBN 0-201-63451-1, August 1996. Section 7.7 "Unique Package Names", on pages 125 and 126 of this specification says in part: You form a unique package name by first having (or belonging to an organization that has) an Internet domain name, such as "sun.com". You then reverse the name, component by component, to obtain, in this example, "com.sun" and use this as a prefix for your package names, using a convention developed within your organization to further administer package names.


b) Covered Code. All Covered Code must constitute a Compliant Implementation prior to any Commercial Use (other than pre-deployment testing), whether originating with You or acquired through a third party. Successful compatibility testing must be completed by You, or by a third party authorized by Original Contributor to conduct such tests, using the most current version of the applicable Compliance Materials available no less than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to Your Commercial Use. If You make any further Modifications to any Covered Code previously determined to be a Compliant Implementation, You must retest the new Covered Code to ensure that it continues to be a Compliant Implementation. For this retest, You may use the same version of the Compliance Materials as used originally or, at your option, You may use a more current version of the Compliance Materials.


c) Test Results. Upon Original Contributor's written request, You agree to provide to Original Contributor or the third party test facility, if applicable, Your test results that demonstrate that Covered Code is a Compliant Implementation, and that Original Contributor may publish or otherwise distribute such test results.


Agreed:
