Copyright Status

SAX is free!

In fact, it's not possible to own a license to SAX, since it's been placed 
in the public domain. 

No Warranty

Because SAX is released to the public domain, there is no warranty for 
the design or for the software implementation, to the extent permitted by 
applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright 
holders and/or other parties provide SAX "as is" without warranty of any 
kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the 
implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. 
The entire risk as to the quality and performance of SAX is with you. 
Should SAX prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, 
repair or correction.  In no event unless required by applicable law or 
agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who 
may modify and/or redistribute SAX, be liable to you for damages, 
including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages 
arising out of the use or inability to use SAX (including but not limited 
to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by 
you or third parties or a failure of the SAX to operate with any other 
programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the 
possibility of such damages.
