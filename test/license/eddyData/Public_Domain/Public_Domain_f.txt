SAX 1.0 

Version 1.0 of the Simple API for XML (SAX), created collectively by 
the membership of the XML-DEV mailing list, is hereby released into the 
public domain.

No one owns SAX: you may use it freely in both commercial and non-commercial 
applications, bundle it with your software distribution, include it on a 
CD-ROM, list the source code in a book, mirror the documentation at your 
own web site, or use it in any other way you see fit.
