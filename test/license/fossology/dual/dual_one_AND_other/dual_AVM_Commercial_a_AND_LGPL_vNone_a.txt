The available AVM driver package consists of two portions, namely an Open
Source Software portion and a Proprietary Source Software portion. The
Proprietary Source Software portion is delivered in binary format only
and includes the firmware (.frm and .bin files) and object code (i.e. the
lib.o files and the drdsl executable). The object code, again, includes
libraries as well as specific portions of the driver. The Open Source
Software portion is licensed under the terms and conditions of the GNU
Lesser GPL (LGPL). Please be aware of the requirements of the LGPL.
You may easily download the terms of the LGPL as follows:

On Debian GNU/Linux systems, the complete text of the GNU Lesser General
Public License can be found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/LGPL'.

In general, you may distribute both portions of the available AVM driver
package, i.e. on a distribution CD delivered in conjunction with your
products. In addition to the terms of the LGPL and under all AVM
intellectual property and proprietary rights, AVM grants you the worldwide,
non-exclusive and royalty-free rights

(1) to use and copy

(2) to make (and have made), use, import, sell, offer for sale or
otherwise distribute any of your (legal) products or services
containing (portions of) the AVM driver package.

The Proprietary Source Software, which is delivered in object code format
only, such as the firmware, the ".o files" and the "drdsl" binary, shall
in no event be disassembled, reverse engineered, decompiled or otherwise
"be opened" and the results realised insofar shall not be copied or
distributed without the prior written approval of AVM except to the extent
as may be expressly authorized under mandatory law and the terms of the LGPL.

It is understood that you will be responsible/liable for the software which
you offer/distribute/make available in conjunction with or which you
combine with (portions of) the AVM driver package. For instance, we refer
to the implications mentioned in the LGPL in case of a breach (your rights
granted under LGPL would terminate automatically, see Art. 4 LGPL). You
should state clearly that you offer any necessary support on your own.
