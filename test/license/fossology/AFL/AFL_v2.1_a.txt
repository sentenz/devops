43	The Academic Free License, v. 2.1:
44	**********************************
45	
46	This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of
47	authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the
48	following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original
49	Work:
50	
51	Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1
52	
53	1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
54	royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the
55	following:
56	
57	a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;
58	
59	b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original
60	Work;
61	
62	c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the
63	public;
64	
65	d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
66	
67	e) to display the Original Work publicly.
68	
69	2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
70	royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent
71	claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original
72	Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the
73	Original Work and Derivative Works.
74	
75	3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred
76	form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
77	documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby
78	agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original
79	Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
80	Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
81	machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
82	reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as
83	long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing
84	the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following
85	the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.
86	
87	4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
88	of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
89	service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
90	Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing
91	in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,
92	patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as
93	expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or
94	offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
95	defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if
96	such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
97	interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this
98	License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
99	license.
100	
101	5) This section intentionally omitted.
102	
103	6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
104	Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
105	Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
106	descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
107	the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
108	Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
109	modified the Original Work.
110	
111	7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
112	the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
113	by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
114	of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
115	and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
116	sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
117	and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
118	the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
119	PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
120	This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
121	license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.
122	
123	8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
124	whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
125	Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
126	or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
127	or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
128	of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
129	other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
130	apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's
131	negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
132	jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
133	consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
134	
135	9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
136	a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
137	obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
138	else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
139	grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work
140	or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt
141	to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
142	between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the
143	equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by
144	exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate
145	Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.
146	
147	10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
148	and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
149	as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,
150	against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
151	patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging
152	patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or
153	hardware.
154	
155	11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
156	License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
157	Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
158	the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
159	application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
160	Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
161	scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
162	requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Ã‚Â§ 101 et
163	seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This
164	section shall survive the termination of this License.
165	
166	12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
167	seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
168	recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
169	attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
170	any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
171	License.
172	
173	13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
174	the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
175	unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
176	make it enforceable.
177	
178	14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
179	in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
180	under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
181	entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
182	under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means
183	(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
184	entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
185	(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
186	entity.
187	
188	15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
189	restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not
190	to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.
191

193	Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without
194	modification. This license may not be modified without the express written
